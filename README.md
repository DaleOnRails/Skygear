**Issues My Application Is Addressing**

*Brief Description*

Identified problems: 
- The australian skydive industry is distinctly undeveloped in the technology sector.
- The amount of platforms available to upload your own listings for pre-owned skydive gear is extremely scarce. 
- The only online platforms available for communication (discussions, blogs, event announcements) in the skydive community are facebook groups.
